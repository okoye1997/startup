# CLASS NOTES

## HTML NOTES

1. Html tags are boxes when `rendered` on the page. Now, you will notice that some of these boxes (aka tags) allow other elements/tags to stay beside it while some other boxes do not allow other elements to stay beside it (i.e on the same line), and they are named block or inline type elements

- Block elements do not allow other tags/elements to be rendered on the same line with them e.g, heading tags (h1, h2, h3), p, section, div, header, footer, nav, ul, ol, form etc. (infact they are mostly container tags)
- Inline elements allow other tags to be rendered besides them. e.g span, button, img, em, b, i, (These ones are mostly styling tags)

## CSS NOTES

1. Inline styling: Writing CSS inside the tags as attributes (This will be considered first)
2. Internal styling: Writing the CSS inside the `head` tag. (before this)
3. _External styling: Which is writing the CSS inside it's own `*.css`file (This is the industry standard)(then this)_

## CSS COLORS

- HEX: Hexadecimal essentially means 16 which is how colors are written in 16 chars 0 - 9 and A to F.

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
00, (black).                                  ff(white)
- HEX starts with a `#` and consider RGB to follow

## CodeTrack Homepage Structure

- Use semantic `section`, `article`, `nav`, `header`, and `footer` elements so assistive technology can identify each part of the page.
- Reusable CSS classes make cards, buttons, the statistics panel, and footer columns easier to style and maintain.
- Use responsive media queries to change multi-column grids into single-column layouts and reveal the menu button on small screens.
- Decorative icons and the heatmap use `aria-hidden="true"`; meaningful images keep descriptive `alt` text.
